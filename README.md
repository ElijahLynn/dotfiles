These are my dotfiles.

This repo is managed with [chezmois](https://www.chezmoi.io/). 
It used to be managed with homeshick - https://github.com/andsens/homeshick and there is some leftover from homeshick I still need to clean up. Someday, someday. 

Need to turn on autocompletion for fish manually with:
`chezmoi completion fish --output=~/.config/fish/completions/chezmoi.fish`
